# CLI checklist project

Very simple project using pyinquirer and a checklist based CLI

## Description
This is a very basic project to try out a few things of pyinquirer, as well as make a checklist CLI to further my python skills.
You can add, remove, and complete tasks.

This is all done using a terminal based interface through pyinquirer supporting arrow keys, toggleable boxes and more.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsjohnson20/SimpleCheckListCLI
```

## Usage
Run the main.py
